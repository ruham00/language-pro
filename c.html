    <h2>What is C?</h2>
    <p>
      C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at
      the Bell Laboratories in 1972. It is a very popular language, despite
      being old. The main reason for its popularity is because it is a
      fundamental language in the field of computer science. C is strongly
      associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating
      system
    </p>
    <p>Why Learn C?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world</li>
      <li>
        If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular
        programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax
        is similar
      </li>
      <li>
        C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and
        Python
      </li>
      <li>
        C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and
        technologies
      </li>
    </ul>
